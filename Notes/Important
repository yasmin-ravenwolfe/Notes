 Interview questions: 

 4 principles of object oriented programming:
  1. Abstraction: creating a focused representation of an object in code (think of code in terms of real world objects)
  2. Polymorphism: redefining (overridding) methods and attributes of a parent class in a subclass.
  3. Inheritance: inheriting methods and methods properties of a parent class in a subclass.
  4. Encapsulation: data hiding. Using getters and setters to allow access to attributes outside of that class. 
  A PIE

Yield:
      class Array
      def collect!
        self.each_with_index! do |value, index|
        self[index] = yield(value)
        # saying replace self index with value
        end
      end

array = [1,2,3,4]
array2 = array.collect! do |n|
  n + 1
end

The above collect! method will put in the index 0 and the value 1 will be yielded to the block in array2. 

Procs vs Lambdas: Lambdas: checks numbers of arguments and will return argument error (procs will just return nil)
